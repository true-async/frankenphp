# Building Custom Docker Image

[FrankenPHP Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/dunglas/frankenphp) are based on [official PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).
Debian and Alpine Linux variants are provided for popular architectures.
Debian variants are recommended.

Variants for PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5 are provided.

The tags follow this pattern: `dunglas/frankenphp:<frankenphp-version>-php<php-version>-<os>`

- `<frankenphp-version>` and `<php-version>` are version numbers of FrankenPHP and PHP respectively, ranging from major (e.g. `1`), minor (e.g. `1.2`) to patch versions (e.g. `1.2.3`).
- `<os>` is either `trixie` (for Debian Trixie), `bookworm` (for Debian Bookworm), or `alpine` (for the latest stable version of Alpine).

## How to Use The Images

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp

COPY . /app/public
```

Then, run these commands to build and run the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t my-php-app .
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app
```

## How to Tweak the Configuration

For convenience, [a default `Caddyfile`](https://github.com/php/frankenphp/blob/main/caddy/frankenphp/Caddyfile) containing
useful environment variables is provided in the image.

## How to Install More PHP Extensions

The [`docker-php-extension-installer`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) script is provided in the base image.
Adding additional PHP extensions is straightforward:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp

# add additional extensions here:
RUN install-php-extensions \
	pdo_mysql \
	gd \
	intl \
	zip \
	opcache
```

## How to Install More Caddy Modules

FrankenPHP is built on top of Caddy, and all [Caddy modules](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/) can be used with FrankenPHP.

The easiest way to install custom Caddy modules is to use [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy):

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp:builder AS builder

# Copy xcaddy in the builder image
COPY --from=caddy:builder /usr/bin/xcaddy /usr/bin/xcaddy

# CGO must be enabled to build FrankenPHP
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 \
    XCADDY_SETCAP=1 \
    XCADDY_GO_BUILD_FLAGS="-ldflags='-w -s' -tags=nobadger,nomysql,nopgx" \
    CGO_CFLAGS=$(php-config --includes) \
    CGO_LDFLAGS="$(php-config --ldflags) $(php-config --libs)" \
    xcaddy build \
        --output /usr/local/bin/frankenphp \
        --with github.com/dunglas/frankenphp=./ \
        --with github.com/dunglas/frankenphp/caddy=./caddy/ \
        --with github.com/dunglas/caddy-cbrotli \
        # Mercure and Vulcain are included in the official build, but feel free to remove them
        --with github.com/dunglas/mercure/caddy \
        --with github.com/dunglas/vulcain/caddy
        # Add extra Caddy modules here

FROM dunglas/frankenphp AS runner

# Replace the official binary by the one contained your custom modules
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin/frankenphp /usr/local/bin/frankenphp
```

The `builder` image provided by FrankenPHP contains a compiled version of `libphp`.
[Builders images](https://hub.docker.com/r/dunglas/frankenphp/tags?name=builder) are provided for all versions of FrankenPHP and PHP, both for Debian and Alpine.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're using Alpine Linux and Symfony,
> you may need to [increase the default stack size](compile.md#using-xcaddy).

## Enabling the Worker Mode by Default

Set the `FRANKENPHP_CONFIG` environment variable to start FrankenPHP with a worker script:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp

# ...

ENV FRANKENPHP_CONFIG="worker ./public/index.php"
```

## Using a Volume in Development

To develop easily with FrankenPHP, mount the directory from your host containing the source code of the app as a volume in the Docker container:

```console
docker run -v $PWD:/app/public -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp --tty my-php-app
```

> [!TIP]
>
> The `--tty` option allows to have nice human-readable logs instead of JSON logs.

With Docker Compose:

```yaml
# compose.yaml

services:
  php:
    image: dunglas/frankenphp
    # uncomment the following line if you want to use a custom Dockerfile
    #build: .
    # uncomment the following line if you want to run this in a production environment
    # restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80" # HTTP
      - "443:443" # HTTPS
      - "443:443/udp" # HTTP/3
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    # comment the following line in production, it allows to have nice human-readable logs in dev
    tty: true

# Volumes needed for Caddy certificates and configuration
volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

## Running as a Non-Root User

FrankenPHP can run as non-root user in Docker.

Here is a sample `Dockerfile` doing this:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp

ARG USER=appuser

RUN \
	# Use "adduser -D ${USER}" for alpine based distros
	useradd ${USER}; \
	# Add additional capability to bind to port 80 and 443
	setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/local/bin/frankenphp; \
	# Give write access to /config/caddy and /data/caddy
	chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /config/caddy /data/caddy

USER ${USER}
```

### Running With No Capabilities

Even when running rootless, FrankenPHP needs the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability to bind the
web server on privileged ports (80 and 443).

If you expose FrankenPHP on a non-privileged port (1024 and above), it's possible to run
the webserver as a non-root user, and without the need for any capability:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp

ARG USER=appuser

RUN \
	# Use "adduser -D ${USER}" for alpine based distros
	useradd ${USER}; \
	# Remove default capability
	setcap -r /usr/local/bin/frankenphp; \
	# Give write access to /config/caddy and /data/caddy
	chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /config/caddy /data/caddy

USER ${USER}
```

Next, set the `SERVER_NAME` environment variable to use an unprivileged port.
Example: `:8000`

## Updates

The Docker images are built:

- when a new release is tagged
- daily at 4 am UTC, if new versions of the official PHP images are available

## Hardening Images

To further reduce the attack surface and size of your FrankenPHP Docker images, it's also possible to build them on top of a
[Google distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) or
[Docker hardened](https://www.docker.com/products/hardened-images) image.

> [!WARNING]
> These minimal base images do not include a shell or package manager, which makes debugging more difficult.
> They are therefore recommended only for production if security is a high priority.

When adding additional PHP extensions, you will need an intermediate build stage:

```dockerfile
FROM dunglas/frankenphp AS builder

# Add additional PHP extensions here
RUN install-php-extensions pdo_mysql pdo_pgsql #...

# Copy shared libs of frankenphp and all installed extensions to temporary location
# You can also do this step manually by analyzing ldd output of frankenphp binary and each extension .so file
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libtree && \
    EXT_DIR="$(php -r 'echo ini_get("extension_dir");')" && \
    FRANKENPHP_BIN="$(which frankenphp)"; \
    LIBS_TMP_DIR="/tmp/libs"; \
    mkdir -p "$LIBS_TMP_DIR"; \
    for target in "$FRANKENPHP_BIN" $(find "$EXT_DIR" -maxdepth 2 -type f -name "*.so"); do \
        libtree -pv "$target" | sed 's/.*── \(.*\) \[.*/\1/' | grep -v "^$target" | while IFS= read -r lib; do \
            [ -z "$lib" ] && continue; \
            base=$(basename "$lib"); \
            destfile="$LIBS_TMP_DIR/$base"; \
            if [ ! -f "$destfile" ]; then \
                cp "$lib" "$destfile"; \
            fi; \
        done; \
    done

## Development Versions

Development versions are available in the [`dunglas/frankenphp-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dunglas/frankenphp-dev) Docker repository.
A new build is triggered every time a commit is pushed to the main branch of the GitHub repository.

The `latest*` tags point to the head of the `main` branch.
Tags of the form `sha-<git-commit-hash>` are also available.
